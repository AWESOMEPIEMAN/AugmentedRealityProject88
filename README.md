# AugmentedRealityProject88
An app that allows you to render 3D models (GLB file through URL) through your phone's camera. The app was made using Google's archived Sceneform AR libraries so support for this project is little to non-existent. You can use this project however way you see fit as long as credit is given. Misuse of the projcet is strictly forbidden.
